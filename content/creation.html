       When creating a character, a player chooses from a list of official classes, backgrounds, and races or some that a dungeon master creates or homebrews. 
		   After choosing a class, a player then rolls 6d20 dice to determine attributes of a character. Next a player chooses languages and abilities they are profiecient in. 
		   After that, a character can choose from a default set of items or buy them. Then, a player chooses spells and sets up their HP and combat stats.
		   Finally, the player sets up the personality of their character.
