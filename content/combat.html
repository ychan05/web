       During combat, each character rolls a dice for intiative to determine which character goes first. During each turn, players can choose to move and perform a various amount of actions, including attacking.
	   Often times when actions are used, the character will roll a die to determine whether or not the action succeeds. After a character completes their action, it is now the next initiative's turn. 
	   This continues until all enemies or players die, are knocked unconcious, or flee.
