	<h2>Basics of Combat</h2>
	 <p> 
       During combat, each character rolls a dice for intiative to determine which character goes first. During each turn, players can choose to move and perform a various amount of actions, including attacking.
	   Often times when actions are used, the character will roll a die to determine whether or not the action succeeds. After a character completes their action, it is now the next initiative's turn. 
	   This continues until all enemies or players die, are knocked unconcious, or flee.

	<h2> Attacking and Defending</h2>
	<p>
	Characters have an AC(armor class) and an attack roll(1d20 + strength or dex modifier + proficiency modifier). The two numbers are then compared and if the AC is lower than or equal to the attack roll, then the attack succeeds.
	Next, the attacking entity rolls for damage based on the weapon and a dex or strength mod. Spells are similar to weapon attacks but use spellcasting mods. Example: AC is 15 and attack roll is 16. The attack succeeds. The attacker rolls for damage. 
	The attacker is using a shortsword, so they roll 1d6 + dex mod.
