      Dungeons and Dragons or commonly known as D&D is a pen and paper roleplaying game played with phyical or digital dice.
      It is often played with a dungeon master(who creates a story and world) and a party consisted of a few players
      (who control characters that live in the world). The story is often set in a fantasy setting and ends 
      when the party's characters die or defeat the BBEG(Big Bad Evil Guy/Girl).
