      Dungeons and Dragons or commonly known as D&D is one of the most popular TRPGs.
	  Published by Wizards of the Coast, the game has developed over 40 years and has
	  released many different books and other products. Many of these books are guides
	  that aid the players and DMs in playing or creating games called campaigns. Some
	  of these books are also prebuilt campaigns that allow DMs to skip the more tedious
	  part of worldbuilding and creation of many differnt NPCs. Other products include
	  video games, board games, and accessories as well.
