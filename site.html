<h1> What is a TRPG?</h1>
<p class="homeText"> A tabletop role-playing game, or TRPG, is a game in which players describe their characters' actions by talking. 
The actions are often determined by the character's charaterization. Players are able to improvise as long as they keep within a general set of rules. 
The players choices will shape the direction, events, and outcomes of the game. Each game is often played with a dungeon master(DM)
who controls the world and creates the story. The game often ends when a Big Bad Evil Guy/Girl(BBEG) is defeated or a specific goal is complete.</p>
