	<h2>How to make a character</h2>
	<p>
       When creating a character, a player chooses from a list of official classes, backgrounds, and races or some that a dungeon master creates or homebrews. 
		   After choosing a class, a player then rolls 6d20 dice to determine attributes of a character. Next a player chooses languages and abilities they are profiecient in. 
		   After that, a character can choose from a default set of items or buy them. Then, a player chooses spells and sets up their HP and combat stats.
		   Finally, the player sets up the personality of their character.

	<h2>Confer with the DM</h2>
	<P>It is often common ettiquete to talk with your DM about whether or not the character is fitting for the campaign. 
	Players also  meet with the DM after the initial character creation session in order to flesh out their individual characters. 
	The DM may also ask players to create some additional characters that have connections to the one that the players are playing.</p>
