	<h2>What exactly is D&D?</h2>
    <p>
      Dungeons and Dragons or commonly known as D&D is a pen and paper roleplaying game played with phyical or digital dice.
      It is often played with a dungeon master(who creates a story and world) and a party consisted of a few players
      (who control characters that live in the world). The story is often set in a fantasy setting and ends 
      when the party's characters die or defeat the BBEG(Big Bad Evil Guy/Girl).

	<h2>Basics of Character Creation</h2>
		<p>
       When creating a character, a player chooses from a list of official classes, backgrounds, and races or some that a dungeon master creates or homebrews. 
		   After choosing a class, a player then rolls 6d20 dice to determine attributes of a character. Next a player chooses languages and abilities they are profiecient in. 
		   After that, a character can choose from a default set of items or buy them. Then, a player chooses spells and sets up their HP and combat stats.
		   Finally, the player sets up the personality of their character.

	<h2>How does combat work?</h2>

    <p>
       During combat, each character rolls a dice for intiative to determine which character goes first. During each turn, players can choose to move and perform a various amount of actions, including attacking.
		   Often times when actions are used, the character will roll a die to determine whether or not the action succeeds. After a character completes their action, it is now the next initiative's turn. 
		   This continues until all enemies or players die, are knocked unconcious, or flee.
